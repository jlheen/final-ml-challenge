<h1>Stock Predictions - Machine Learning Project</h1>
<h3>Author: Jade Tao, Jodi Heen, and Tim Lucas</h3>
<h6>WUSTL Data Analytics Bootcamp final project Weeks 23-24.</h6>

<h6>Project Summary</h6>
<p>Using Alpha Vantage’s APIs for the stock data collected over the last 10 years, we  will train and compare four different models in predicting the direction of today's closing price with respect to yesterday's closing price based on the features we've selected. Our users will be able to choose a certain stock symbol from a dropdown list and see a stock visualization which shows the historical and predicted closing values of the selected stock (and then it’s up to them if they want to immediately set up a brokerage account and buy it).</p>
